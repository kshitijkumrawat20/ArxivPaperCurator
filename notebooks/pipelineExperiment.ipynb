    "- Database Integration - Store and retrieve papers from PostgreSQL\n",
    "- Complete Pipeline - End-to-end processing from arXiv to database\n",
    "- Production Readiness - Error handling, logging, and performance metrics\n",
    "### 📊 Success Metrics\n",
    "- arXiv API calls succeed with proper rate limiting\n",
    "- PDF download and caching works reliably\n",
    "- Docling extracts structured content from scientific PDFs\n",

There is, however, scientific consensus that AI systems can reflect and exacerbate societal biases, raising concerns about identity-based harm when used in critical social contexts. Prior work has laid a solid foundation for assessing bias in LLMs by evaluating demographic disparities in different language reasoning tasks. In this work, we extend single-axis fairness evaluations to examine intersectional bias, recognizing that when multiple axes of discrimination intersect, they create distinct patterns of disadvantage. We create a new benchmark called WinoIdentity by augmenting the WinoBias dataset with 25 demographic markers across 10 attributes, including age, nationality, and race, intersected with binary gender, yielding 245,700 prompts to evaluate 50 distinct bias patterns. Focusing on harms of omission due to underrepresentation, we investigate bias through the lens of uncertainty and propose a group (un)fairness metric called Coreference Confidence Disparity which measures whether models are more or less confident for some intersectional identities than others. We evaluate five recently published LLMs and find confidence disparities as high as 40% along various demographic attributes including body type, sexual orientation and socio-economic status, with models being most uncertain about doubly-disadvantaged identities in anti-stereotypical settings. Surprisingly, coreference confidence decreases even for hegemonic or privileged markers, indicating that the recent impressive performance of LLMs is more likely due to memorization than logical reasoning. Notably, these are two independent failures in value alignment and validity that can compound to cause social harm.', categories=[], published_date='2025-08-09T22:24:40Z', pdf_url='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.07111v1'),\n",
       " ArxivPaper(arxiv_id='2508.07107v2', title='Designing a Feedback-Driven Decision Support System for Dynamic Student Intervention', authors=['Timothy Oluwapelumi Adeyemi', 'Nadiah Fahad AlOtaibi'], abstract='Accurate prediction of student performance is essential for enabling timely academic interventions. However, most machine learning models used in educational settings are static and lack the ability to adapt when new data such as post-intervention outcomes become available. To address this limitation, we propose a Feedback-Driven Decision Support System (DSS) with a closed-loop architecture that enables continuous model refinement. The system employs a LightGBM-based regressor with incremental retraining, allowing educators to input updated student performance data, which automatically triggers model updates. This adaptive mechanism enhances prediction accuracy by learning from real-world academic progress over time.   The platform features a Flask-based web interface to support real-time interaction and integrates SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for model interpretability, ensuring transparency and trustworthiness in predictions. Experimental results demonstrate a 10.7% reduction in RMSE after retraining, with consistent upward adjustments in predicted scores for students who received interventions. By transforming static predictive models into self-improving systems, our approach advances educational analytics toward human-centered, data-driven, and responsive artificial intelligence. The framework is designed for seamless integration into Learning Management Systems (LMS) and institutional dashboards, facilitating practical deployment in real educational environments.', categories=[], published_date='2025-08-09T21:24:54Z', pdf_url='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.07107v2')]"
